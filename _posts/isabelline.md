Choosing the visual properties of a website can be tricky.



For the background of my website I ended up choosing an off-white color called "Isabelline".

Its a color frequently seen in nature:

<div class="slideshow fade">
	{% include image.html name="Quarter_Horse(REFON).jpeg" caption="Light palomino Quarter Horse, which may be described as isabelline." source="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabelline_(colour)" %}
	{% include image.html name="Lanius_isabellinus1.jpeg" caption="Isabelline shrike." source="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabelline_(colour)" %}
	{% include image.html name="Quarter_Horse(REFON).jpeg" caption="Light palomino Quarter Horse, which may be described as isabelline." source="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabelline_(colour)" %}
	{% include image.html name="Lanius_isabellinus1.jpeg" caption="Isabelline shrike." source="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabelline_(colour)" %}
	{% include image.html name="Quarter_Horse(REFON).jpeg" caption="Light palomino Quarter Horse, which may be described as isabelline." source="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabelline_(colour)" %}
	{% include image.html name="Lanius_isabellinus1.jpeg" caption="Isabelline shrike." source="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabelline_(colour)" %}
</div>

I personally find it pleasing to the eye, not at all
